        <li>1 (16 ounce) package pasta</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>2 ½ tablespoons pesto</li>

    </ul>



    <h2>Pesto Pasta Ingredients Extra Information</h2>
    You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the
    basics:
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pasta:</strong> Start with your favorite pasta shape.</li>
        <li><strong>Onion and oil:</strong> Cook the onion in olive oil until it's translucent.</li>
        <li><strong>Pesto:</strong> Use store-bought or homemade pesto sauce.</li>
        <li><strong>Seasonings:</strong> This pesto pasta is simply seasoned with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li><strong>Cheese:</strong> Grate your own Parmesan cheese instead of using the pre-shredded stuff.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in pasta and return to a boil.
            Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 to 10 minutes.
            Drain and transfer into a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat oil in a frying pan over medium-low heat. Add onion; cook and stir until softened, about 3
            minutes. Stir in pesto, salt, and pepper until warmed through.</li>
        <li>Add pesto mixture to hot pasta; stir in grated cheese and toss well to coat.</li>
    </ol>
